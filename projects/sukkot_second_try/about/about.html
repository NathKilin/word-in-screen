                "Without art, life would lose its intensity, its brilliance, and its breath; art is the mirror where humanity sees its sorrows and joys, its laughter and tears, and through it, each of us finds a piece of ourselves, a reason to endure, to dream, to keep going; for, at its core, art is the purest form of survival and the proof that, despite everything, we still believe in beauty."
